# Import, clean, and join all raw data (KB)
```{r}
weather = read.csv(here("data","raw-data","weather-data.csv"))
airquality = read.csv(here("data","raw-data","air-quality-data.csv"))
boston = read.csv(here("data","raw-data","boston-marathon-data.csv"))

nyc = read.csv(here("data","raw-data","nyc-marathon-data.csv"))
berlin = read.csv(here("data","raw-data","berlin-marathon-data.csv"))
```

Look at the raw datasets (KB)
```{r}
str(boston)
str(berlin)
str(nyc)
str(chicago)
str(weather)
str(airquality)
```
We can see that several of the datasets have varying variable names/formats for year, marathon, gender, and chip_time. We can also see there are variables that are not necessary in several of the marathon datasets.

## Standardize all datasets (KB)
Standardize all the raw marathon datasets; clean variable names and select necessary variables.
```{r}
boston_clean <- boston %>%
  transmute(
    year = year,
    marathon = "Boston",
    gender = gender,
    chip_time = official_time
  )

berlin_clean <- berlin %>%
  transmute(
    year = YEAR,
    marathon = "Berlin",
    gender = GENDER,
    chip_time = TIME
  )

nyc_clean <- nyc %>%
  transmute(
    year = Year,
    marathon = "NYC",
    gender = Gender,
    chip_time = Finish.Time
  )

chicago_clean <- chicago %>%
  transmute(
    year = Year,
    marathon = "Chicago",
    gender = Gender,
    chip_time = Finish.Time
  )
```
Standardize the raw weather data; format the variables names to make them clean (KB)
```{r}
weather_clean <- weather %>%
  transmute(
    year = Year,
    marathon = Marathon,
    high_temp = High.Temp,
    low_temp = Low.Temp,
    avg_temp = Day.Average.Temp,
    precipitation = Precipitation,
    dew_point = Average.Dew.Point,
    wind_speed = Max.Wind.Speed,
    visibility = Visibility,
    sea_level_pressure = Sea.Level.Pressure
  )
```

Standardize the raw airquality data; format the variables names to make them clean (KB)
```{r}
airquality_clean <- airquality %>%
  transmute(
    year = Year,
    marathon = Marathon,
    aqi = Overall.AQI.Value,
    main_pollutant = Main.Pollutant,
    co = as.numeric(CO),
    ozone = as.numeric(Ozone),
    pm10 = suppressWarnings(as.numeric(PM10)),
    pm25 = as.numeric(PM2.5),
    no2 = as.numeric(NO2)
  )
```

## Combine the marathon datasets (KB)
```{r}
# using bind_rows so we can row-wise combine and have data for each runner
marathons_all <- bind_rows(
  boston_clean,
  berlin_clean,
  nyc_clean,
  chicago_clean
)
str(marathons_all)
```
We can see that marathons_all contains the identifying variables (*year, marathon, gender*), and the outcome variable *chip_time*.

Select only years we need (1996 to 2025) (KB)
```{r}
marathons_all <- marathons_all %>%
  filter(year >= 1996 & year <= 2025)

unique(marathons_all$year)
```
We can that the merged marathon data set now contains years from 1996 to 2023, as most dont have data up to 2025.

## Chip-Time Cleaning Function (KB)
Need chip_seconds to find the average finishing times (pulled from chatgbt)
```{r}
# Cleans and standardizes chip-time values by converting Excel-style numeric
# times to HH:MM:SS, trimming and formatting text times, replacing invalid 
# entries with NA, and padding missing leading zeros.

clean_chip_time <- function(x) {

  # Convert numeric Excel-style times to character HH:MM:SS
  x_numeric <- suppressWarnings(as.numeric(x))
  is_fraction <- !is.na(x_numeric) & x_numeric < 1 & x_numeric > 0
  
  x[is_fraction] <- format(
    as.POSIXct("1970-01-01", tz = "UTC") + x_numeric[is_fraction] * 86400,
    "%H:%M:%S"
  )
  
  # Everything else treat as text and clean
  x <- as.character(x)
  x <- trimws(x)
  
  # Replace known invalid strings with NA
  invalid <- c("", "NA", "N/A", "—", "-", "DNF", "DNS", "DQ", "no time", "No Time", "NO TIME")
  x[x %in% invalid] <- NA
  
  # Pad missing zeros (H:MM:SS → HH:MM:SS, etc.)
  x <- gsub("^([0-9]):", "0\\1:", x)
  x <- gsub(":([0-9]):", ":0\\1:", x)
  x <- gsub(":([0-9])$", ":0\\1", x)
  
  return(x)
}
```

Clean chip_time; using `clean_chip_time` function (KB)
```{r}
marathons_all <- marathons_all %>%
  mutate(chip_time_clean = clean_chip_time(chip_time))
```

Convert the cleaned chip_time values (HH:MM:SS) to hms() and period_to_seconds() and gets a new column chip_seconds (KB)
```{r}
marathons_all <- marathons_all %>%
  mutate(
    chip_seconds = suppressWarnings(period_to_seconds(hms(chip_time_clean)))
  )

head(marathons_all)
```
We can see `chip_time` with the original data, `chip_time_clean` with the uniform cleaned data across all marathons, and `chip_seconds` with the total time in seconds. 

## Remove missing finish times (KB)
Need to see what we want to do with these missing values and where they are coming from (KB)
```{r}
marathons_all %>% 
  summarize(missing_finish_times = sum(is.na(chip_seconds)))

marathons_all %>% 
  filter(is.na(chip_seconds))
```
We can see that there are only 3 rows with missing chip_times.

Remove missing finish times. This is safe because we only use average finishing times in our model, so individual missing times do not matter. Also there are only 3 total
```{r}
marathons_all <- marathons_all %>%
  filter(!is.na(chip_seconds))
```

## Labeling Gender (KB)
Label as 'male', 'female', or 'unknown', and we decided that nonbinary falls under female.
```{r}
# Check all unique names under gender
unique(marathons_all$gender)
```
We can see that there are a lot of ways 'male', 'female', 'nonbinary', and 'unknown' are labled.

Make all the genders uniform and standardized (KB)
```{r}
marathons_all <- marathons_all %>%
  mutate(
    gender = tolower(gender),
    gender = case_when(
      gender %in% c("male", "m") ~ "male",
      gender %in% c("female", "f", "w", "x", "nonbinary", "nb") ~ "female",
      TRUE ~ "unknown"
    )
  )

table(marathons_all$gender)
```
We can see that now we only have three genders, `female`, `male`, and `unknown` which consist of 56 rows.  

Remove unknowns since we have only 56 unknowns, and they will not help the model and most likely add noise: (KB)
```{r}
marathons_all <- marathons_all %>% 
  filter(gender != "unknown")

table(marathons_all$gender)
```
We successfully removed the unknowns, leaving us with the desired `female` and `male`. 

## Create Preformance Subgroups (KB)
Create a variable called winner_time, that consist of the winners or best finishing for that year. Then create a variable called time_ratio (), that consists of chip_seconds / winner_time. 
```{r}
# Add winner_time for each marathon-year-gender
runners <- marathons_all %>%
  group_by(marathon, year, gender) %>%
  mutate(winner_time = min(chip_seconds, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(time_ratio = chip_seconds / winner_time)
```

Create subgroups based on time_ratio. Look at a histogram to adjust the boundaries of the subgroups based on the distribution of the histogram of time_ratio and clear clusters. (KB)
```{r}
runners <- runners %>%
  mutate(
    subgroup = case_when(
      time_ratio <= 1.30 ~ "elite",
      time_ratio > 1.30 & time_ratio <= 1.55 ~ "competitive",
      time_ratio > 1.55 & time_ratio <= 1.80 ~ "average",
      time_ratio > 1.80 & time_ratio <= 2.10 ~ "recreational",
      time_ratio > 2.10 ~ "slow",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_
    ),
    subgroup = factor(subgroup, levels = c("elite", "competitive", "average", "recreational", "slow"))
  )

# Create histogram of ratio_time amongst male and female runners with boundaries for subgroups in red
ggplot(runners, aes(x = time_ratio, fill = gender)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("female" = "deeppink", "male" = "steelblue")) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(1.3, 1.55, 1.80, 2.10), linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Runner Time Ratios to Winner by Gender",
    x = "Time Ratio (Runner / Winner)",
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```



Looking at the histogram of the time_ratio above, we can see that there is a clear clustering in runner-to-winner time ratios and a long right-skewed tail, which helped with the placement of the performance thresholds/ vertical dashed red lines (1.30, 1.55, 1.80, 2.10). We can also see that the distribution for both male and female follow a similar shape, with overall less female relative male runners. Overall, this figure supports the use of ratio-based performance categories by illustrating natural clustering and skewness in marathon finishing times.

Now we can further divide the subgroups created by genders. (KB)
```{r}
runners %>%
  group_by(gender, subgroup) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(gender, subgroup)
```
We can see that the subgroups now have groups for `male` and `female`. We can see that the elite groups both has less runners and male runners have more runners in each group overall. We will leave this as is because these cutoffs are not arbitrary, and they follow the natural shape of the data rather than relying on fixed percentile breaks. Weighting could later be applied; however, it is not initially because subgroup effects are not the primary focus.


## Compute average finishing time per subgroup (KB)
```{r}
avg_times <- runners %>%
  group_by(marathon, year, gender, subgroup) %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),  # number of runners in each subgroup
    avg_chip_seconds = mean(chip_seconds, na.rm = TRUE),  
    .groups = "drop"
  )

avg_times
```
We now have a dataset that contains 1005 rows and 6 columns/ variables. This means that some of the years must be missing for some of the marathon as we know previously when collecting the raw data. Berlin goes from (1996 to 2019), Boston goes from (1996 to 2019), Chicago goes from (1996 to 2023), and NYC goes from (1996 to 2024). Also, after looking through the dataset more, we can see that Berlin is missing data from all female subgroups in 2019 and NYC is missing all male subgroups for 2024. We will leave the data as is because having missing years and genders is not our primary focus, as our focus is on having as much data for finishing/chip times as possible.

## Left join weather and airquality data with marathon datasets (KB)
```{r}
final_data <- avg_times %>%
  left_join(weather_clean, by = c("year", "marathon")) %>%
  left_join(airquality_clean, by = c("year", "marathon"))

# move n (number of individuals representing each group) to the first column for neatness
final_data <- final_data %>% 
  select(n, everything())

final_data
str(final_data)
```
We can see that all the datasets were merged into one final_data successfully. We now have a new column `n` that counts the amount of runners in each group for future computations and potential weighing if needed.

```

The table above summarizes key descriptive statistics for continuous variables in the dataset, including average marathon chip time (in seconds), temperature measures, humidity-related metrics (dew point), wind speed, visibility, air pressure, and air quality indicators (aqi, co, ozone, pm10, pm2.5, no2). For each variable, the table reports its mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, skewness, kurtosis, and sample size, giving an overview of central tendency, variability, distribution shape, and data completeness.

All the variables show reasonable ranges and central values for weather and airquality conditions during the marathon events. We can see that chip times cluster around 4 hours (about 15,600 seconds) with moderate variability. Temperature measures (high, low, and average) fall within typical seasonal ranges, while air-quality variables such as ozone, pm10, pm2.5, and co show right-skewed distributions, indicating occasional higher pollution days. Visibility also shows strong right skew and high kurtosis, suggesting a few unusually high values compared with the rest of the data. Overall, most variables are moderately skewed, with some (like visibility and co) showing heavier tails.

## Figure 5: Scatter plot for pollutants (KB)
Looking at all the  pollutants we have concerns with (co, pm10, pm2.5, and overall aqi).
```{r}
# Make pollutant data into long format for graphing
pollutant_long <- final_data %>%
  mutate(
    finish_hours = avg_chip_seconds / 3600   # convert seconds to hours
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(co, pm25, pm10, aqi),
    names_to = "pollutant",
    values_to = "value"
  )

# plotting scatter plots
ggplot(pollutant_long, 
       aes(x = value, y = finish_hours, color = pollutant)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "loess") +
  facet_wrap(~ subgroup, scales = "free") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  labs(
    title = "Pollution vs. Finish Times by Performance Subgroup",
    x = "Pollutant Level (AQI)",
    y = "Average Finishing Time (hours)",
    color = "Pollutant"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)

```



We can see that most of the subgroups follow similar patterns with airquality. As airquality increase, we see an increase in most average finishing times, with some starting to level out at a certain pollutant level among faster subgroups, such as `pm2.5` for elite and competitive subgroups. We can also see that `co` behaves oddly, specifically for slow runners, increasing as fishing time get faster with higher pollutant levels. However this is most likey due to missing `co` data for Berlin.

```{r}
continuous_vars <- final_data %>% 
  select(avg_chip_seconds, high_temp, low_temp, avg_temp, 
         dew_point, wind_speed, visibility, sea_level_pressure,
         aqi, co, ozone, pm10, pm25, no2) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "variable", values_to = "value")

ggplot(continuous_vars, aes(x = value)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "#4A90E2", color = "white") +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Histograms of Continuous Variables",
       x = "Value",
       y = "Count")

```


Looking at histograms for all the continuous variables, we can see the distribution shapes. Several of the environmental variables did display expected right skews (such as PM2.5 and wind speed). There is no transformation currently planned for our modeling goals. We can also see that finishing times were right skewed, which is typical for marathon data.


## Figure 7: Scatter plots of subgroups (KB)
We want to see how subgroups behave over the years.
```{r}
# Scatter plots by marathon and subgroup
ggplot(final_data, aes(x = year, y = avg_chip_seconds)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = subgroup), alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +  # points colored by subgroup
  geom_smooth(aes(color = subgroup), method = "loess", se = FALSE) + # optional trend lines
  facet_wrap(~ marathon) +  # one plot per marathon
  labs(
    title = "Average Marathon Finishing Times by Year and Subgroup",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Finishing Time (seconds)",
    color = "Performance Subgroup"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )

```


We cans see that over time, most finishing times become faster. We can also see potential shifts in faster finishing times past 2018, where there was the introduction of supershoes. We can really see this in the Chicago marathon, as it has data till 2023. We can potentially see the trend starting with Berlin, however it is hard to tell since the data is only available till 2019. NYC seems to have a pretty  constant finishing times over the years. Boston on the other hand, seems to have increasing finishing times, however it is also hard to interpret the affect of supershoes due to data only being available till 2019, only one year after supershoes have been widely introduced. 

## Figure 8.  (MH)
```{r}
#Add 'Overall' graph, making df 'final_data2' for purpose of figure 8 and  9
final_data2 <- final_data %>% mutate(subgroup = tolower(as.character(subgroup))) %>% bind_rows(final_data %>% 
mutate(subgroup = "overall")) %>%
  mutate(subgroup = factor(subgroup,levels = c("elite", "competitive", "average", "recreational", "slow", "overall")))
final_data2$year <- as.numeric(as.character(final_data2$year))

#Visibility and Finishing time
ggplot(final_data2, aes(x = visibility, y = avg_chip_seconds / 3600, color = marathon)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype=gender),method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~ subgroup, scales = "free_x") + 
  labs(title = "Overview of the Relationship Between Visibility and Finishing Time by Performance Subgroup",
       x = "Visibility (mi)",
       y = "Average Finishing Time (hours)"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```
A decrease in visibility appears to slow down runners across all subgroups.

## Figure 9: (MH)
```{r}
# Average Finishing Time by Year, Subgroup, Gender (Supershoes)
ggplot(final_data2, aes(x = year, y = avg_chip_seconds, color = marathon)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype=gender),method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~ subgroup, scales = "free_x") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2018, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", linewidth = 1) +  # vertical line
  labs(title = "Average Finishing Time Over the Years",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Average Finishing Time (hours)"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "right")


```
With the introduction of supershoes around 2018 (red vertical dashed line), we expect to see in improvement in finishing time. This is true for all subgroups except for slow runners. The slow runners make up the largest number of runners in each marathon. The increase could be due to the larger number of runners in the subgroup, it could also be due to an increase in charity bibs at races - where runners do not have to explicitly qualify with a qualifying time in order to run.

# Preprocessing and Feature Engineering (KB, ZD, MH)

Look at the full dataset for missing values (ZD, KB)
```{r}
# Summarize missing values
missing_summary <- final_data %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), ~sum(is.na(.))))

# Keep only columns with any missing values
missing_summary <- missing_summary %>%
  select(where(~any(. > 0)))

# Display nicely in HTML
knitr::kable(missing_summary, caption = "Missing Values per Variable")

```

We can see that `visability`, `co`, `pm10`, and `pm25` all have alot of missing values. This is due to the Berlin dataset.

## Berlin as a second case study (KB)
Spit the data so Berlin is used as a second case study to show how the method performs with missing data (whether successful or not).
```{r}
main_data <- final_data %>% filter(marathon != "Berlin")
berlin_data <- final_data %>% filter(marathon == "Berlin")

str(main_data)
```
We can see the main_data with out berlin now has 770 obs. and 21 variables. 

## Handling Missing Values (ZD, KB)
```{r}
# Summarize missing values
missing_summary <- main_data %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), ~sum(is.na(.))))

# Keep only columns with at least one missing value
missing_summary <- missing_summary %>%
  select(where(~any(. > 0)))

# Display nicely in HTML
knitr::kable(missing_summary, caption = "Missing Values per Variable")

```

In the main_data, we can see that there are still 320 missing values for pm10 and 70 missing values for pm2.5. 

### Remove PM10 (KB)
Since PM10 has a lot of missing values still, we will drop that column completely.
```{r}
main_data <- main_data %>%
  select(-pm10) 
```

### KNN Imputation on PM2.5 (KB)
Since PM2.5 is often the main pollutant, we decided to use KNN imputation to fill missing PM2.5 values because it predicts missing data using similar rows without assuming a specific parametric relationship, preserves variance, and works well for our relatively small dataset while using correlations with other environmental variables.
```{r}
# Impute missing PM2.5 values using 5 nearest neighbors
main_data <- kNN(main_data, variable = "pm25", k = 5) # can change later to see which K gives best model performance 

# remove pm25_imp
cols_to_remove <- c(
  "pm25_imp"
)

main_data <- main_data[, !(names(main_data) %in% cols_to_remove)]

# Check that missing values are filled
summary(main_data$pm25)
```
We can see that there are no missing values now and we can get a clean summary of the data. 

Convert categorical variables to factors: (KB)
```{r}
main_data  <- main_data  %>%
  mutate(subgroup = factor(subgroup),
         gender = factor(gender),
         marathon = factor(marathon),
         main_pollutant = factor(main_pollutant))

str(main_data)
```
We can see that the identifiers (subgroup, gender, marathon) and predictor (main_pollutant) were all converted to factors so that our models can properly recognized them. 

## Feature engineering (ZD, KB)
```{r}
# create interaction terms and convert supershoe to factor
main_data_fe <- main_data %>%
  mutate(
    supershoe = factor(ifelse(year >= 2018, 1, 0), levels = c(0, 1)),
    temp_dew_interaction       = avg_temp * dew_point,
    temp_aqi_interaction       = avg_temp * aqi, 
    temp_precip_interaction    = avg_temp * precipitation,
    temp_wind_interaction      = avg_temp * wind_speed,
    pm25_temp_interaction      = pm25 * avg_temp,
    dew_wind_interaction       = dew_point * wind_speed,
    pressure_temp_interaction  = sea_level_pressure * avg_temp,
    avg_temp_gender_interaction = avg_temp * as.numeric(gender == "male")
  )

str(main_data_fe)
```

## Correlation Check (KB)
Need to do a Quick correlation check for numeric variables and see what features inroduce multicollinearity.
```{r}
# Find numeric columns after feature engineering, excluding 'year' and 'n' since they are idenifiers
numeric_vars <- main_data_fe %>%
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>%
  select(-year, -n) %>% 
  names()

numeric_vars
```
We can see that there are a total 14 continuous variables, disincluding the identifiers `year` and `n`. 

Creat Correlation Matrix and make a visual: (KB)
```{r}
cor_matrix <- cor(main_data_fe[numeric_vars], use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

# rounding
round(cor_matrix, 2)

#ploting
corrplot(
  cor_matrix,
  method = "color",
  col = colorRampPalette(c("blue", "white", "red"))(200),
  tl.cex = 0.6
)
```


Looking at the visual, we can see that a lot of these features were highly correlated and will have to be removed. For example, high_temp and low_temp are strongly correlated with avg_temp (0.93 and 0.92), and aqi overlaps with pm25 (0.94). Interaction terms like temp_dew_interaction, temp_precip_interaction, and pressure_temp_interaction show very high correlations with their constituent variables (up to 1.00), making them redundant. Similarly, main_pollutant is just a categorical version of aqi. Overall, these features provide little additional information and can be removed to reduce multicollinearity. 

## Observing categorical variables (KB)
Looking at their distributions to see if we should keep or remove them.
```{r}
table(main_data_fe$main_pollutant)
table(main_data_fe$supershoe)
```

We can see that main_pollutant still contains data from pm10 which was removed. Also we know that main_pollutant is the categorical variable for aqi, and since aqi is highly correlated with pm2.5 (often the main_pollutant), we will drop aqi and main_pollutant all together. 

Looking at the supershoes variable, there is an expected imbalance, with more observations of years without supershoes (0 = 640) and fewer with supershoes (1 = 130) since they were introduced more recently in 2018. We will keep this as a control variable, and if needed, techniques like weighting can be applied to help the imbalance.

Removing correlated variables as seen above: (KB)
```{r}
cols_to_remove <- c(
  "high_temp",
  "low_temp",
  "aqi",
  "temp_dew_interaction",
  "temp_precip_interaction",
  "temp_wind_interaction",
  "pm25_temp_interaction",
  "dew_wind_interaction",
  "pressure_temp_interaction",
  "main_pollutant" 
)

main_data_fe <- main_data_fe[, !(names(main_data_fe) %in% cols_to_remove)]
str(main_data_fe)

```
Now we have a dataset that has 770 obs. and only 19 variables after the addition of newly engineered features and removal if highly correlated features.

Decision tree looking at weather and airquality features to consider breaking down into bins.
reference: https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/DT.html (MH) (KB)
```{r}
feature_check <- rpart(
  avg_chip_seconds ~ avg_temp + precipitation + dew_point + wind_speed + visibility +
    sea_level_pressure + co + ozone + pm25 + no2 + supershoe + temp_aqi_interaction + covid_era,
  data = train_data_tree,
  method = "anova"
)

# Plot showing important features and potential bins
rpart.plot(feature_check)
```


We can see that the decision tree shows that wind speed is the most important factor, splitting at 13 units. For higher wind speeds, ozone and temperature further influence the outcome. For lower wind speeds, temperature is the main driver.

Getting the results (KB)
```{r}
combined_results <- bind_rows(
  cv_cont$results    %>% mutate(Model = "cv_cont"),
  cv_bin$results     %>% mutate(Model = "cv_bin"),
  cv_temp$results    %>% mutate(Model = "cv_temp"),
  cv_temp_ozone$results %>% mutate(Model = "cv_temp_ozone"),
  cv_airbin$results  %>% mutate(Model = "cv_airbin"),
  cv_ozone$results   %>% mutate(Model = "cv_ozone"),
  cv_wind$results    %>% mutate(Model = "cv_wind"),
  cv_wind_air$results %>% mutate(Model = "cv_wind_air")
) %>%
  select(Model, everything())  

print(combined_results)
```
We can see that the model with ozone and PM2.5 binned has the lowest RMSE and MAE, suggesting higher accuracy, and one of the highest R2 to explain variability. The model with just ozone binned has the highest R2, but also slightly higher RMSE and MAE.

Based on these results, we will incorporate the binned ozone and PM2.5 features into our final dataset for modeling and test a couple of initial models with the continuous version of these features, as well as the binned version.

## LASSO (KB)
LASSO is being used to answer the following question: 
Which version of the air-quality and temperature features should we keep for the final model?

Add our 90/10 training/test split for LASSO (KB, ZD)
```{r}
# split data into train and test
set.seed(123)

train_index <- sample(1:nrow(main_data_fe), size = 0.9 * nrow(main_data_fe)) # use a 90/10 split

train_data_scaled <- main_data_fe[train_index, ]
test_data_scaled <- main_data_fe[-train_index, ]
```

Data Scaling for LASSO and later linear regression model (ZD, KB)
```{r}
# Identify numeric predictors to scale (exclude outcome and identifiers)
numeric_vars <- train_data_scaled %>%
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>%
  select(-avg_chip_seconds, -year, -n) %>%
  names()

# scale training data and save scaling parameters
train_scaled <- scale(train_data_scaled[numeric_vars])
train_data_scaled[paste0("scaled_", numeric_vars)] <- train_scaled

train_center <- attr(train_scaled, "scaled:center")
train_scale  <- attr(train_scaled, "scaled:scale")

# Scale test data (only numeric vars that exist in test)
numeric_vars_test <- intersect(numeric_vars, names(test_data_scaled))
test_scaled <- scale(test_data_scaled[numeric_vars_test],
                     center = train_center[numeric_vars_test],
                     scale  = train_scale[numeric_vars_test])
test_data_scaled[paste0("scaled_", numeric_vars_test)] <- test_scaled


summary(train_data_scaled[paste0("scaled_", numeric_vars)])

```
We can see that all the continuous variables for the train and test data, not including the identifying variables `year` and `n`, were successfully scaled with means at 0 and standard deviations of 1, showing that the standardization was correctly applied.

train_data_scaled$pm25_bin  <- factor(ifelse(train_data_scaled$pm25 >= 54, 1, 0), levels = c(0, 1))

test_data_scaled$ozone_bin <- factor(ifelse(test_data_scaled$ozone >= 38, 1, 0), levels = c(0, 1))

train_data_scaled <- train_data_scaled %>%
  select(-all_of(numeric_vars))

test_data_scaled <- test_data_scaled %>%
  select(-all_of(numeric_vars_test))

```

We made the factor levels:  
- ozone bin: 0 = low, 1 = high
- pm25 bin: 0 = low, 1 = high

Prepare the predictor matrix (x) and outcome vector (y) (KB)
```{r}
# Only using ozone and PM2.5 (continuous and binned)
x_train <- model.matrix(avg_chip_seconds ~ scaled_ozone + scaled_pm25 + 
                        ozone_bin + pm25_bin, data = train_data_scaled)[,-1]  # remove intercept
y_train <- train_data_scaled$avg_chip_seconds

x_test <- model.matrix(avg_chip_seconds ~ scaled_ozone + scaled_pm25 + 
                       ozone_bin + pm25_bin, data = test_data_scaled)[,-1]
y_test <- test_data_scaled$avg_chip_seconds
```

Run LASSO with cross-validation to select lambda (KB)
```{r}
set.seed(123)

lasso_cv <- cv.glmnet(x_train, y_train, alpha = 1, standardize = FALSE)  # already scaled

# Find the best lambda
best_lambda <- lasso_cv$lambda.min
best_lambda

# Fit final LASSO model at best lambda
lasso_model <- glmnet(x_train, y_train, alpha = 1, lambda = best_lambda, standardize = FALSE)

# Check coefficients
coef(lasso_model)

# Predict on test set
preds <- predict(lasso_model, newx = x_test)

# Evaluate performance
rmse <- sqrt(mean((y_test - preds)^2))
mae  <- mean(abs(y_test - preds))
rmse
mae

```
We can see that both binned features and scaled_pm25 were retained showing (.). We can also see that scaled_ozone shrank to nearly 0, which means it did not contribute to the predicting average chip time once the binned values were also included. The model achieved an RMSE of 3383 seconds and a MAE of 2861 seconds, suggesting that good predictive performance. 


For a simpler and more interpretable model, we will drop the original numeric features and keep only the binned features based on LASSO results (KB)
```{r}
# Remove scaled_ozone and scaled_pm25 from training and test
train_data_scaled <- train_data_scaled[, !(names(train_data_scaled) %in% c("scaled_ozone"))]
test_data_scaled  <- test_data_scaled[, !(names(test_data_scaled) %in% c("scaled_ozone"))]

train_data_scaled <- train_data_scaled[, !(names(train_data_scaled) %in% c("scaled_pm25"))]
test_data_scaled  <- test_data_scaled[, !(names(test_data_scaled) %in% c("scaled_pm25"))]

str(train_data_scaled)
str(test_data_scaled)
```

We can see that scaled ozone was successfully removed from both train and test data. Now this dataset is ready for our initial linear regression model.

```

The results of the Regression model shows the model is a good fit. The figure of observed v. predicted shows a strong linear relationship, and as the R2 for both train and test data (0.9866, 0.9892 respectively) suggests the model is able to account for almost 99% of the variation the model. This is likely due to subgroups finishing times being manually generated, and being a heavy driver for predicted finshing times which may skew interpretation of the effects of environmental predictors on subgroups and gender. Due to the small size of the dataset, we were unable to have subgroup and or gender as an interaction term for the whole model, therefore we will now investigate XGBoost models to help us develop a model to understand these interactions

Add our 90/10 training/test split with no scaling (ZD)
```{r}
# split data into train and test
set.seed(42)

train_index <- sample(1:nrow(main_data_fe), size = 0.9 * nrow(main_data_fe)) # use a 90/10 split

train_data <- main_data_fe[train_index, ]
test_data  <- main_data_fe[-train_index, ]
```

Add Binned features based off Decision Tree (ozone_bin and pm25_bin) (KB)
```{r}
# Training data 
train_data$ozone_bin <- factor(ifelse(train_data$ozone >= 38, 1, 0), levels = c(0, 1))
train_data$pm25_bin  <- factor(ifelse(train_data$pm25 >= 54, 1, 0), levels = c(0, 1))

# Test data using same thresholds
test_data$ozone_bin <- factor(ifelse(test_data$ozone >= 38, 1, 0), levels = c(0, 1))
test_data$pm25_bin  <- factor(ifelse(test_data$pm25 >= 54, 1, 0), levels = c(0, 1))
```

We made the factor levels:  
- ozone bin: 0 = low, 1 = high
- pm25 bin: 0 = low, 1 = high

Remove ozone and pm25 based on LASSO results and keeping the ozone and opm25 bins based on decision tree (KB)
```{r}
# Remove ozone and pm25 from training and test data
train_data <- train_data[, !(names(train_data) %in% c("ozone", "pm25"))]
test_data  <- test_data[, !(names(test_data) %in% c("ozone", "pm25"))]

str(train_data)
str(test_data)
```

We can see that ozone and pm25 were successfully removed from both datasets and we now have the binned features.

We can see that the baseline XGBoost model fits the training data almost perfectly, with a very low RMSE of 4.37 and an R2 of 1.0. However, its performance drops sharply on cross validation and test data (RMSEs around 152–165), which shows the model is overfitting and memorizing the training data rather than learning patterns that generalize. While the test R2 is still high, the large absolute errors mean predictions on new data would likely be unreliable. Overall, the model works great on the data it has seen but struggles when faced with unseen examples.

### Introduce cross validation hyperparameter tuning (KB)
Do this by running a tuning loop.

To make sure our XGBoost model is as accurate and reliable as possible, we built a hyperparameter-tuning loop. We can use this instead of guessing which settings would give us the best performance. This loop is able to automatically test several combinations using 5-fold cross-validation. It then checks how well the model predicts on unseen data and records the best RMSE and number of boosting rounds. Then it selects the combination with the lowest cross-validated error. The tuning loop is a balanced model that is flexible enough to capture real patterns and its regularized enough to avoid memorizing all the noise.

**NOTE** Models may be slightly different with small fluctuations that are likely due to sampling variability.

After tuning, our XGBoost model with engineered features shows substantial improvement over the baseline, though care should still be taken when interpreting training performance metrics.

Although hyperparameter tuning substantially reduced test RMSE, the gap between training and test performance still remains large. This suggests that tuning improved overall predictive accuracy but did not fully eliminate overfitting, which is likely due to the small dataset.

The 5-fold CV RMSE (145.68) is slightly higher than the test RMSE (127.41), indicating the model generalizes reasonably well, though the test set may be somewhat easier to predict. 

Both R2 values indicate excellent fit (Train R2 ≈ 0.9999, Test R2 = 0.9987). The nearly perfect training R2 is likely a result of engineered subgroup features capturing much of the variability.

Overall, the tuned model outperforms the baseline, reducing test RMSE from ~155.7 to ~127.4 (~18% reduction), improving predictive accuracy and stability. While training performance remains very strong, the model still shows some overfitting, likely due to the small dataset.


### Check for variable importance (ZD, KB)
```{r}
# Variable importance amongst final XGBoosted model
importance <- xgb.importance(model = xgb_model)
print(importance)

xgb.plot.importance(importance)
```
We can see that subgroupslow and subgroupelite are the features the model relied on most to reduce prediction error. Variables like avg_temp or sea_level_pressure are less influential but still contribute a little. Features with extremely low Frequency are ozone_bin1, precipitation, and visibility, which are barely used by the model.

```

We can see the untuned XGBoost model using raw features fits the training data almost perfectly (Train RMSE = 5.73, Train R2 = 1.0), but its performance drops substantially on the test set (Test RMSE = 163.04, Test R2 = 0.9976). This large gap between training and test errors indicates that the model is strongly overfitting: it memorizes the training data rather than learning patterns that generalize. While the test R2 is still very high, the absolute errors are large, suggesting predictions on new data would likely be unreliable.


## Introduce cross validation hyperparameter tuning (KB)
Do this by first running a tuning loop on the raw features as done previously (KB)

To make sure our XGBoost raw features model is as accurate and reliable as possible, we built a hyperparameter-tuning loop. We can use this instead of guessing which settings would give us the best performance. This loop is able to automatically test several combinations using 5-fold cross-validation. It then checks how well the model predicts on unseen data and records the best RMSE and number of boosting rounds. Then it selects the combination with the lowest cross-validated error. The tuning loop is a balanced model that is flexible enough to capture real patterns and its regularized enough to avoid memorizing all the noise.

**NOTE** Models may be slightly different with small fluctuations that are likely due to sampling variability.

After tuning, our XGBoost model shows substantial improvement over the baseline, but some caution is still warranted regarding overfitting, so care should be taken when interpreting training performance metrics.

Although hyperparameter tuning substantially reduced test RMSE, the gap between training and test performance still remains large. This suggests that tuning improved overall predictive accuracy but did not fully eliminate overfitting, which is likely due to the small dataset. (Train RMSE ≈ 30.66, Test RMSE ≈ 120.86).

The 5-fold CV RMSE (177.89) is higher than the test RMSE (120.86), indicating the model generalizes reasonably well, though the test set may be somewhat easier to predict. 

Both R2 values indicate excellent fit (Train R2 ≈ 0.9999, Test R2 ≈ 0.9987). The nearly perfect training R2 is likely a result of the raw features capturing much of the variability rather than overfitting.

Overall, the tuned raw-feature XGBoost model outperforms the untuned baseline, reducing test RMSE from ~154.76 to ~120.86 (~22% reduction), improving predictive accuracy and stability. While training performance remains very strong, the model still shows some overfitting, likely due to the small dataset.

```{r}
# Variable importance amongst final XGBoosted model
importance <- xgb.importance(model = xgb_raw_model)
print(importance)

xgb.plot.importance(importance)
```
We can see that subgroupslow and subgroupelite are the features the model relied on most to reduce prediction error. Variables like wind_speed or low_temp are less influential but still contribute a little. Features with extremely low Frequency are main_pollutantPM25, precipitation, and main_pollutantOzone, which are barely used by the model.

After evaluating both the raw-feature and engineered-feature XGBoost models, clear differences in performance and stability can be seen.

The engineered-feature model has a lower training error (Train RMSE ≈ 45.86, Train MAE ≈ 33.34) and better cross-validation performance (CV RMSE ≈ 151.61) compared to the raw-feature model (Train RMSE ≈ 59.73, Train MAE ≈ 44.38, CV RMSE ≈ 164.67). This indicates that the engineered features help the model fit the training data more accurately and generalize more consistently across folds.

The engineered-feature model also achieves better test performance (Test RMSE ≈ 138.40, Test MAE ≈ 91.01) than the raw-feature model (Test RMSE ≈ 151.72, Test MAE ≈ 113.05), demonstrating that feature engineering improves predictive accuracy and stability on unseen data.

Both models achieve extremely high R2 values on training and test sets (≈0.998–0.999), showing that they capture nearly all variability in the target variable. Overall, the engineered-feature model is recommended, as it provides lower errors, better generalization, and more stable performance, while the raw-feature model performs worse across both CV and test metrics and may be less reliable on new data.

##SHAP
Implement SHAP (ZD)

# SHAP
# Compute SHAP values for the raw XGB model
shap_values <- shap.values(
  xgb_model = xgb_model,
  X_train = train_matrix
)

shap_long <- shap.prep( # convert SHAP values to long format
  xgb_model = xgb_model,
  X_train = train_matrix
)
shap.plot.summary(shap_long)

```

SHAP values to left of 0 (negative) represent decreases in predicted finishing time, while SHAP values to the right of 0 (positive) represent increases in predicted finishing time.

Marathon location proves to be important in determining race results. Elite runners strongly decreased in predicted finishing time, while slow runners strongly increased in predicted finishing time. Temperature, ozone, dew point, and PM2.5 influence finishing time but their effects are limited compared to the subgrouping impacts.

Low PM2.5 values equate to a minimal effect on finishing time. Moderate PM2.5 values display performance weakening. High PM2.5 values show that the model predicts faster times. Extremely high PM 2.5 values seem to lead to slower times for runners.

Temperature displays a much clearer impact than the PM2.5 results. At lower temperatures, the SHAP values are negative and ultimately predict a faster finishing time. At moderate temperatures, the effects are rather neutral. At higher temperatures, the SHAP values begin to rise, indicating a slower predicted finish. While extremely warm temperatures the SHAP values sharply increase the predicted finishing time by a rough average of 400 seconds. Generally speaking, colder temperatures appear to improve race time while warmer temperatures hinder race time.

rmse_berlin <- rmse(actual_berlin, pred_berlin)
mae_berlin  <- mae(actual_berlin, pred_berlin)

rss_berlin <- sum((actual_berlin - pred_berlin)^2)
tss_berlin <- sum((actual_berlin - mean(actual_berlin))^2)
r2_berlin  <- 1 - rss_berlin / tss_berlin

# Results table
berlin_eval <- data.frame(
  Metric = c("RMSE", "MAE", "R²"),
  Value  = c(rmse_berlin, mae_berlin, r2_berlin)

knitr::kable(
  berlin_eval,
  digits = 4,
  caption = "XGBoost Engineered-Feature Model Performance on Berlin Test Data"
)

# Show how many rows were dropped
cat("Total Berlin rows:", nrow(berlin_data_clean), "\n")
cat("Rows used for prediction (complete cases):", nrow(berlin_cc), "\n")
cat("Rows dropped due to missing predictors:", nrow(berlin_data_clean) - nrow(berlin_cc), "\n")
```
We can see that the results indicate that the XGBoost engineered-feature model predicts average chip times for Berlin marathon runners with high accuracy on the subset of data with complete predictor information. The R2 of 0.9174 shows that over 91% of the variance in actual chip times is explained by the model.

Out of 235 total Berlin observations, only 60 rows (or around 26%) were actually used for prediction. 175 rows (or around 74%) were dropped due to missing values in predictors. This is a substantial portion of the dataset, which means the evaluation metrics reflect model performance only on the complete-case subset.

**Note:** The reported performance may not fully represent how the model would perform on the entire Berlin dataset, so caution should be used when generalizing these results.

**Summary:**

In preparing the Berlin marathon data for out of sample prediction with the XGBoost model, we first removed unavailable predictors (marathon identifier and CO concentration) from both the training and Berlin datasets to ensure a consistent feature space. The training model matrix was rebuilt and the XGBoost model retrained using only the remaining predictors.

Categorical predictors in the Berlin dataset were explicitly aligned to match the levels in the training data, ensuring correct encoding. Since model.matrix() automatically drops rows with missing predictor values, we restricted the Berlin dataset to complete cases before building the design matrix and making predictions. The Berlin feature matrix was then aligned to the training feature space to prevent feature mismatches.
Predictions were made only on the complete case rows, and model performance was evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and R2. 

It is important to note that we also tracked how many Berlin observations were dropped due to missing predictors to maintain transparency.

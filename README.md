# Project Title: 
Predicting Marathon Finisher Rates: The Impact of Weather and Air Quality on the Boston Marathon

## Background: 
Weather conditions in the Boston Marathon vary drastically from year to year and can strongly influence the number of runners who finish.

This project looks at how factors like temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation, and air quality influence the percentage of runners who finish the race each year. The goal is to see whether these environmental conditions can help predict finisher rates over time.

Understanding these patterns could help:

- prepare medical officials and medical tents with support needs
- event organizers to prepare hydration stations in the most effective ways
- runners to prepare their pacing and set their expectations as a result of given weather conditions 

## Research Question: 
Can weather and environmental factors (such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and air quality) predict the proportion of finishers in the Boston Marathon for a given year?

## Hypothesis & Predictions
 
**Hypothesis:** Poor weather conditions (higher temperatures, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, or worse air quality) are associated with a lower proportion of finishers.

**Predictions:**  Races held in hotter, more humid, or poor air quality conditions are expected to have fewer finishers, while moderate temperatures, clearer days should see higher completion rates.
